* Motivation

Historically, video editing has progressed from destructive techniques, ie. cutting the negative, to non-destructive ones, ie. non-linear
editing. The latter has become possible due to film being no longer analog but digital. In both cases, however, the creative process is manual, or mouse-based. A different approach, often overlooked, is programmatic: the editor spells out the edits he wants to apply, and those are being carried out by an underlying system. 
FFmpeg is such a system; capable of carrying pretty much any editing instruction you can think of. 

Bioscoop puts programmability in the center of the creative process in tis a  to program videos
(instead of non-linear editing). It is a Domain Specific Language
(DSL) builds upon that transforms how
developers work with FFmpeg filtergraphs.

* Inspiration

#+begin_quote
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:

1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all
   complex ideas are made.

2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex,
   together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of
   them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all
   its ideas of relations.

3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany
   them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus
   all its general ideas are made.

â€”John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)
