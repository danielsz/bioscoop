* Motivation

Historically, video editing has progressed from destructive
techniques, ie. cutting the negative, to non-destructive ones,
ie. non-linear editing. The latter has become possible due to film
being no longer analog but digital. In both cases, however, the
creative process is manual, or mouse-based. A different approach,
often overlooked, is programmatic: the editor spells out the edits he
wants to apply, and those are being carried out by an underlying
system.  FFmpeg is such a system; capable of carrying pretty much any
editing instruction you can think of.

FFmpeg is embedded in virtually every major platform and application
that handles media, yet its use in the creative coding community to
make video art is limited. Most video creators prefer to stay away
from the notoriously complex and error-prone string-based
syntax. Indeed, its usability is hindered by the information density
of its textual interface.

Bioscoop unleashes FFmpeg from its shackles and puts programmability
in the center of the creative process.

* Internals

The project is structured around several key components:

*** *DSL Parser (=src/bioscoop/dsl.clj=)*
- Uses *Instaparse* to parse a Lisp-like syntax defined in =resources/lisp-grammar.bnf=
- Grammar allows for expressions like =(scale 1920 1080)= and =(let [width 1920] (scale width 1080))=
- Supports typical Lisp constructs: functions, let bindings, symbols, keywords, strings, numbers, booleans
- Transformation of the parse tree into internal representation
  
*** *Core Data Structures*
Three main records represent FFmpeg concepts:
- *Filter*: A single filter operation (e.g., scale, overlay, crop)
- *FilterChain*: A sequence of filters connected in series (comma-separated in FFmpeg)
- *FilterGraph*: Multiple filter chains running in parallel (semicolon-separated in FFmpeg)
  

*** *Domain Model (=src/bioscoop/domain/=)*
- Uses Clojure Spec to define the structure of filters, filter chains, and filtergraphs
- Provides validation for the core data structures

*** *Rendering Engine (=src/bioscoop/render.clj=)*
- Implements the =FFmpegRenderable= protocol to convert data structures to FFmpeg syntax
- Handles input/output labels for complex filtergraphs 
- Ensures proper escaping and formatting

*** Bidirectional Translation
- /src/bioscoop/render.clj/: Converts DSL → FFmpeg filtergraph strings
- /src/bioscoop/ffmpeg.clj/: Parses existing FFmpeg filtergraph strings → DSL structures


* The filtergraph

In FFmpeg, atomic editing operations—such as scaling, cropping,
blending, and color correction—are implemented as filters. With over
500 filters available, FFmpeg provides extensive transformation
capabilities.

When multiple filters are applied sequentially to source material,
they form a filterchain, written as comma-separated
commands. Filterchains can be labeled at their input and output
points, allowing one chain's output to serve as another's input. These
interconnected filterchains create a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
structure, which FFmpeg calls a filtergraph.  Filtergraphs are passed
to FFmpeg using the ~-filter_complex~ parameter.

A key limitation of FFmpeg filtergraphs is that they exist only as
strings—there is no structured data format or intermediate
representation. Filtergraphs are hard-coded directly as text strings
passed to the -filter_complex parameter, with no abstraction layer
between the user and the final syntax.

This creates several challenges:

*No programmatic structure*: Unlike many modern tools that use JSON,
YAML, or object-based APIs, filtergraphs cannot be easily constructed,
validated, or manipulated programmatically. There's no schema to
reference, no type checking, and no ability to introspect the graph
structure before execution.

*String concatenation dependency*: Building dynamic filtergraphs
requires manual string concatenation, making the code fragile and
error-prone. A single misplaced comma, semicolon, or bracket can break
the entire pipeline, with errors only surfacing at runtime.

*Limited tooling support*: Because filtergraphs lack a formal
representation, IDEs cannot provide syntax highlighting,
auto-completion, or validation. Developers must memorize the syntax or
constantly reference documentation.

*Debugging difficulty*: When a filtergraph fails, error messages
reference the string position rather than logical components, making
it hard to identify which filter or connection caused the problem.

This string-only representation means filtergraphs are essentially
"write-only" code—difficult to read, maintain, and programmatically
generate at scale.

* Inspiration

#+begin_quote
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:

1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all
   complex ideas are made.

2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex,
   together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of
   them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all
   its ideas of relations.

3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany
   them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus
   all its general ideas are made.
