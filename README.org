* Bioscoop

** Motivation 

Yes, FFmpeg is everywhere and it is amazing, but it is mainly used for
post-processing. Bioscoop is an attempt to unleash the power of FFmpeg
in the creative process. It offers an alternative to Non-Linear
editing of videos in favor of a programmatic approach.

FFmpeg offers a wealth of filters that can be
terseness, information density


FFmpeg has asserted its dominance in the post-processing phase of
video 
Unleash the power of FFmpeg in the creative process, beyond its
dominance in the post-processing

It is a language-focused solution to the information density problem
of FFmpeg's filtergraph syntax.
It's not only that they are dense and terse, they lack
abstractions. They do not allow for composition, which is a key
principle when designing a system.

Told in the words of communties:

- Clojurians: a dsl that compiles Lisp forms to FFmpeg's filtergraph
- PLT: A context-free grammar describing a simple Lisp language -> AST transformation into data structues
-
